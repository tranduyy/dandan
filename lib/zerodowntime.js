// When bin/pump is performing a zero-downtime restart, it loads this
// module and compares this number with its version. If the new
// version is greater than the old version, it will refuse.
//
// Basically, just increment this whenever online restarting is
// potentially harmful. For example, when bin/pump is changed (because
// this would leave you with an old bin/pump managing newer worker
// processes).
