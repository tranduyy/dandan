# This file is deliberately set up to provide an extremely restricted environment for pump.io.
# It is strongly recommended that you keep all security options enabled - there is no good reason to disable them and doing so will make things much easier for an attacker in the event of a compromise.

# See also the notes below about PrivateTmp to further increase security.

# Security restrictions
# We can't do a whitelist-based {Inaccessible,ReadOnly,ReadWrite}Paths setup because it muddles execute perms
# Instead, we blacklist what we almost for sure don't need. This is obviously much worse, but what're you gonna do?
