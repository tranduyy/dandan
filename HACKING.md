# HACKING

Some quick documentation for hackery of pump.io.

## JAVASCRIPT

* [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) should run without errors.
* [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js) is about right, with below exceptions.
* 4-character indent, spaces only (no tabs).
* double-quotes for strings.
* No internal space for parentheses; so "if (foo)", not "if ( foo )".
* Use [Step](https://github.com/creationix/step).
* Use [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).
* Use [databank](https://github.com/evanp/databank). Don't write to some storage engine's API.
* Use [vows](http://vowsjs.org/).

You can check for (most) style violations with `npm run lint:jscs`, and you can check for JSHint errors with `npm run lint:jshint`.

## TEMPLATES

* Templates are written in [Pug](https://pugjs.org)
* Templates are precompiled to JS for client-side rendering. You need to recompile with `npm run build` every time you change templates.
* 2-character indent, spaces only.
* Use `.classname` instead of `div.classname` - ditto for `div#id` and `#id`
* Use `#[]` interpolation

You can check for style violations with `npm run lint:pug`.

## LOGGING

* Use [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for logging.
* Use these log levels:
  * `error`: A problem that was not recovered from.
  * `warning`: A problem that was recoverable. Example:
    distribution to a remote user with an invalid address, authentication failure.
  * `info`: Events of interest to system administrators who don't hack the code.
    Data crossing the process boundaries should get a single `info` log item.
    Example: sending an email, delivery of an activity to a remote user, sending
    an activity to the firehose, a Web request.
  * `debug`: Events of interest to developers of pump.io. Example: enter/exit
    a function, before/after a databank search.
* Don't use the log level `trace`.
  
## GENERAL

* Write tests first. Or, at least, soon after.
* Use github issues to track issues.
* Use Markdown for documentation.
